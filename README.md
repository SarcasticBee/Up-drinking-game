# Up-drinking-game
This is code for a drinking game called "Up". The rules are the following: The players sit in a circle. One players calls out the number 1, and the one to his left calls out the next number (it would be 2) and so on. A number "up" (usually 7) is decided, and when a player is at either the 'up' (ex: 7), a multiple of 'up' (ex: 14), or a number containing the 'up' (ex: 17), he/she has to say "Up". EX if up is 3: one, two, up, four, five, up, seven, eight, up, ten, eleven, up, up, etc...
